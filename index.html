    dear ria,
    <br><br>
    happy valentine's day!
    <br><br>
    look, i'm gonna cut to the chase: we both read the mysterious benedict society at a very impressionable age, and it gave us very deep and hard-to-satisfy urges.
    this site is an attempt to satisfy some of those urges. for you, engaging in a series of mysterious puzzles and riddles. and for me, putting together a series of mysterious puzzles and riddles.
    anyway i got a small set of puzzles for you, themed around the Things from the past ~year of our relationship
    <br><br>
    once you get an answer, text me and i'll confirm it for you. and, if you want hints at any time, text me! i tried to make these easy-medium, but these puzzles are incredibly untested so i have no way of knowing.
    also text me if you have thoughts in general! (like "what the fuck you're making me do work" or "did you do any homework at all this weekend," to which my answers are "yes" and "ha ha")
    <br><br>
    anyway the reason i am doing this is because (a) puzzles are the only way i know how to express love, and (b) i know you are more than capable of finishing these.
    like not to simp but you're one of the smartest people i know and i am 100% sure you will crush it. text me when u get the final answer and i'll send you something special <3
    <br><br>
    love you, <br>
    paolo
